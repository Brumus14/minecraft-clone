Check for any race conditions / multithreading bugs (potentially to do with chunk iteration)
Improve meshing like greedy meshing
Sometimes get invalid frees probably due to multithreading issues
Reimplement collision
Gravity
Make flying more responsive
Better lighting
Blocks orient correctly when placed
Bug when moving fast: malloc(): unsorted double linked list corrupted
Frustum culling
Hashmap not copy value instead take malloc'd pointer and return to free
Allow workers to schedule tasks for chain tasking
Don't mesh blocks on chunk borders so wait for bordering chunks to generate terrain
Maybe when modifying chunk don't re-mesh entire chunk just modified part
