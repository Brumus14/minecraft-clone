This is a fairly simple Minecraft clone that I programmed in C using OpenGL along with some libraries: cglm for maths, glad for OpenGL functions, glfw for windowing and input, noise for random world generation, stb for loading images.

The game is still being developed so may not currently be playable.

To run first clone the git respository then do the following:
```
mkdir build
make
```
And then run the executable.
